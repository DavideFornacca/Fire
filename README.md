# Dataset of vegetation fire events (polygons) in northwest Yunnan from 1987 to 2018

Link to dataset: coming soon

This dataset has been produced using a methodology specifically designed to overcome common issues encountered in remote sensing applications in complex landscapes. It is applied burned are extraction. The difficulties tackeld are:

- Small fires
- Rugged terrain
- Frequent cloud coverage
- Patchy vegetation
- Fast post-fire reovery
- No training data
